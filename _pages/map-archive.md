**Warning** - THESE MAPS ARE HARD ON THE EYES... VIEW AT YOUR OWN DESCRETION.

This page shows all the older maps I've created throughout my GIS/ Map-Making journey. Please recognize that many of these maps are (subjectively) quite bad, and therefore should not be used as a template or example for your own work. These are purely for reflection and posterity.
